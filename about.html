<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I’m <strong>Bryant “Colby” Hood</strong> — a strategic finance leader and builder who sits at the intersection of 
finance operations, automation, and AI. For over a decade, I’ve helped large retail and technology organizations 
(Amazon, Capital One, Lowe’s, Academy Sports + Outdoors) turn complex operational problems into scalable, data-driven systems.
</p>

<p>
At Amazon, I lead Finance Operations for Retail Accounts Receivable, managing a $40B contra-COGS revenue stream and building AI-driven automation that replaces hundreds of manual processes. 
My work blends technical execution with controllership: designing automation roadmaps, scaling self-service analytics, and using AI to enhance everything from collections strategy to cross-business financial modeling. 
</p>

<p>
Before Amazon, I built the foundation for large-scale financial automation programs at <strong>Capital One</strong> and <strong>Lowe’s</strong> — from AWS cost-optimization saving $40M+ to developing Power BI dashboards that replaced hundreds of hours of manual FP&A effort.
</p>

<h3>Core Strengths</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AI & Automation:</strong> RPA (UiPath, n8n, Zapier), Python scripting, and AI workflow design</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Strategy:</strong> FP&A planning, AR/AP optimization, and process redesign</li>
  <li><strong>Data Analytics:</strong> Power Query, DAX, SQL, and QuickSight for advanced financial modeling</li>
  <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Team development, change management, and cross-functional influence</li>
  <li><strong>Operational Execution:</strong> Streamlining financial systems and driving measurable efficiency gains</li>
</ul>

<p>
I earned my <strong>MBA in Data Analytics</strong> from Wake Forest University and hold an AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.  
My focus now is on building and scaling intelligent finance systems — where automation, analytics, and accountability intersect.
</p>

<p>
Outside work, I’m an unapologetic gym rat, youth sports coach, and lifelong student of systems — whether human or machine. 
If it’s measurable, improvable, or automatable, I’m probably already tinkering with it.
